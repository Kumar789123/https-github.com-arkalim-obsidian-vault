# Resource Access Manager (RAM)
- Share AWS resources with **other AWS accounts** to avoid resource duplication
- Each participating account manage their own resources
- Participating accounts canâ€™t view, modify, delete resources that belong to other participants or the owner

## VPC Sharing
- Allows to share **one or more subnets** with other accounts **within the same organization**
- Allows multiple accounts to create resources into shared and **centrally-managed** VPCs
- **Cannot share the whole VPC**
- Network is shared (high degree of interconnectivity)
    -   every resource deployed in the subnet can talk to each other using **private IP**
    -   security groups from other accounts can be referenced
