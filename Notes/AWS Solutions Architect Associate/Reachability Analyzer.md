# Reachability Analyzer
-   A network diagnostics tool that **troubleshoots network connectivity** between two endpoints in your VPC
-   It builds a model of the network configuration, then checks the reachability based on these configurations (**doesnâ€™t send packets, just tests the configurations**)
-   When the destination is:
    -   Reachable - it produces hop-by-hop details of the virtual network path
    -   Not reachable - it identifies the blocking components (eg. configuration issues In SGs, NACLs, Route Tables, etc.)
-   Use cases:
    -   Troubleshoot connectivity issues
    -   Ensure network configuration is as intended
