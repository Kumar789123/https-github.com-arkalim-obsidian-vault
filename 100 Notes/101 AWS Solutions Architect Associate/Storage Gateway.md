# Storage Gateway
- Bridge between on-premises data and [[Simple Storage Service (S3)|S3]] for **Hybrid Cloud**
- Not suitable for one-time sync of large amounts of data (use [[DataSync]] instead)
- Optimizes data transfer by sending only changed data

## Types of Storage Gateway

#### S3 File Gateway
-   Used to expand on-premise NFS by leveraging S3
-   Configured S3 buckets are accessible on premises using the **NFS** and **SMB** protocol
-   **Data is cached at the file gateway** for low latency access
-   Can be mounted on many servers on-premises
-   Integrated with **Active Directory (AD)** for user authentication

#### Volume Gateway
-   Used for on-premise storage volumes
-   Uses **iSCSI protocol**
-   Two kinds of volumes:
    -   **Cached volumes**: storage extension using S3 with caching at the volume gateway
    -   **Stored volumes**: entire dataset is on premise, scheduled backups to S3 as **EBS snapshots**

#### Tape Gateway
- Used to backup on-premises data using tape-based process to S3 as Virtual Tapes
- Uses **iSCSI protocol**

#### FSx File Gateway
- Used to expand on-premise storage by leveraging FSx for Windows
- Windows native compatibility (SMB, NTFS, Active Directory)
- **Data is cached at the file gateway** for low latency access

## Storage Gateway - Hardware Appliance
-   Storage Gateway requires on-premises virtualization. If you donâ€™t have virtualization available, you can use a Storage Gateway - Hardware Appliance. It is a mini server that you need to install on-premises.
-   **Does not work with FSx File Gatway**
