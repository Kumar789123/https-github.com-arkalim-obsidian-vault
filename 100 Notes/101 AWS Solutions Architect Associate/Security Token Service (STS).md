# Security Token Service (STS)
- Used to grant limited and temporary access to AWS resources
- Token is valid for up to 1h

## AssumeRole
- Allows IAM Users to assume an IAM Role
- Steps to assume a role
	- Create an lAM Role (within your account or cross-account)
	-   Role Policy: define which principals should be allowed to assume this role
	-   Use STS AssumeRole API to retrieve temporary credentials for the IAM role
	-  STS will check with IAM whether or not the user is allowed to assume that role

- Use cases:
	- Safety: deleting a resource first requires users to temporarily assume a role
	- **Cross-account access**: assume role in target account to perform actions there

## AssumeRoleWithSAML
- Allow non IAM users logged in with SAML to assume an IAM role

## AssumeRoleWithWebldentity
- Allow non IAM users logged in via an identity provider (Facebook, Google, etc.) to assume an IAM role
- AWS recommends using [[Cognito]] instead
