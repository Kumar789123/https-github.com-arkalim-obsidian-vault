#### Scalability
-   Ability to handle greater loads by adapting
-   **Vertical Scalability** (scaling up / down)
	-   increasing the size (performance) of the instance
	-   used in non-distributed systems, such as a database.
	-   limited by hardware
-   **Horizontal Scalability** (elasticity) (scaling out / in)
	-   increasing the number of instances of the application
	-   used in distributed systems
	-   easier to achieve than vertical scalability

#### High Availability
- Ability to survive a hardware or AZ failure
- Achieved by running at least 2 instances of the application in different AZs
