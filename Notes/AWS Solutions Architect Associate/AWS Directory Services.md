# AWS Directory Services
- Used to extend the AD network by involving services like EC2 to be a part of the AD to share login credentials.

> [!tip]- Exam tip 
> Use AWS Managed Microsoft AD unless the problem specifically asks for properties of AD Connector or Simple AD

## AWS Managed Microsoft AD
-   Login credentials are shared between on-premise and AWS managed AD
-   **Manage users on both AD (on-premise and on AWS managed AD)**
-   Supports MFA
-   Establish trust connections with your on premise AD
- Supports **directory-aware workloads on AWS**

## AD Connector
-   AD connector will proxy all the requests to the on-premise AD
-   **Users are managed on the on-premise AD only**
- Does not support directory-aware workloads on AWS

## Simple AD
-   AD-compatible managed directory on AWS (**cannot be joined with on-premise AD**)
-   **Users are managed on the AWS AD only**
-   Use when you donâ€™t have an on-premise AD
