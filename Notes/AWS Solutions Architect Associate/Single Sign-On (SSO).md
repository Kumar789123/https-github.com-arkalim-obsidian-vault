# AWS Single Sign-On (SSO)
- **Free service**
- **Integrated with AWS Organizations** (login once for your org and you can access all the accounts within that org)
- **Integration with on-premise Active Directory**
- **Supports SAML 2.0**
- Centralized auditing with CloudTrail

## Federated SSO vs AWS SSO
- With Federated SSO, we need to maintain a **3rd party identity provider** (AD/ADFS, CUP, Google, Facebook, custom identity broker) login portal. The IDP returns the JWT or SAML Assertion which the client needs to exchange with STS for login credentials. 
- With AWS SSO, we donâ€™t need to manage the login portal, it is done through the AWS SSO. It returns the credentials directly.
