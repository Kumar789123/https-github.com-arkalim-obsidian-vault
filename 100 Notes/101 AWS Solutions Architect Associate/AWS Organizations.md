# AWS Organizations
- **Global service**
- Manage multiple AWS accounts under an organization
	- 1 master account
	- member accounts
- An AWS account can only be part of one organization
- Consolidated Billing across all accounts
- Pricing benefits from aggregated usage of AWS resources
- API to automate AWS account creation (on demand account creation)
- Establish Cross Account Roles for Admin purposes where the master account can assume an admin role in any of the children accounts

## Organizational Units (OU)
- Folders for grouping AWS accounts of an organization
- Can be nested

## Service Control Policies (SCP)
- Whitelist or blacklist IAM actions at the OU or Account level

- Applies to all the Users and Roles of the Account, including the Root User. So, if something is restricted for that account, even the root user of that account wonâ€™t be able to do it.
- Must have an explicit allow (**does not allow anything by default**)
- **Does not apply to service-linked roles**
- **Explicit Deny** has the highest precedence
