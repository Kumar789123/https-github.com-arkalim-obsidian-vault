# Linux

## Theory
### Operating System
- Most operating systems can be grouped into two families:
- The Microsoft NT descendants including Windows, Xbox Os, and Windows Phone /Mobile
- Pretty much everything else has lineage going back to Unix, including Mac OS X, Linux, Android, Chrome OS, and even the PS4 OS
-   Kernel
	- Kernel is a part of an OS that facilitates interactions between hardware and software. Linux is not an OS, it is just a kernel (part of the OS)
		- ![[attachments/Pasted image 20220603192111.png]]
    
-   Linux Distributions
	- The Linux Kernel itself is not a full-blown operating system. When people talk about a Linux-based operating system, they are referring to Linux distributions. Typically, a Linux distribution bundles together the Linux kernel, GNU tools, documentation, a package manager, a window system, and desktop environment. There are nearly 1000 Linux distros available. Some of the more popular ones includes Fedora, Ubuntu, Debian, and Slackware.
    
-   Shell
	- A shell is a computer interface to an operating system. Shells expose the OS's services to human users or other programs. The shell takes our commands and gives them to the operating system to perform. Linux commands run via a shell.
	- It's named a shell because it is the outer layer around the OS, like the shell around an oyster!
	- Shells are of various types but they all do the same thing (run linux commands)
	    -   Bourne Shell (sh)
	    -   Korn Shell (ksh)
	    -   Bourse Again Shell (bash)
	    -   zsh
-   Permissions
    
    Linux was designed to allow multiple users to access a single system at the same time. So, every file needs to be protected. There is also the concept of group permissions where all developers can be put into a group and a set of permissions can be attached to each file for that group.
    
    Permissions in Linux are of three types:
    
    -   Read (4)
    -   Write (2)
    -   Execute (1)
    
    Directories always have execute permission onto them which allows the user to get into the folder.
    
    -   Permission Structure
        
        ![Untitled](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/44f460ab-ff5a-4e66-a144-0f0c351c3996/Untitled.png)
        
        ![Untitled](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/58ea4ac8-8c58-4ed8-9916-01becbd522ed/Untitled.png)
        
    
    When changing permissions for a file:
    
    777 - full permission
    
    400 - read only (required for `.pem` keys)
    
-   Expansions
    
    These are some keywords that the shell interprets:
    
    -   `~` path of home directory
        
        `cd ~/Desktop`
        
    -   `$` environment variables
        
        `$PATH` path variable
        
        `$USER` user variable
        
    -   `*` all paths (wildcard)
        
        -   `ls *.txt` print every text file in the current directory
    -   `?` any character
        
        -   `ls *.??` matches `app.js` `main.py` etc.
    -   `{}` iterator
        
        -   `touch app.{py, js, html, css}` create four files with the extensions as given
        -   `touch Journal-{1..365}.txt` iterate over numbers

# Commands

-   `uname` prints the kind of system you are running.
    
-   `man commandName` prints the manual for a linux command.
    
-   `uptime` print how long your system has been up.
    
-   `pwd` print current working directory
    
-   `mkdir my-dir` make a directory by the name `my-dir`
    
-   `alias greet="nano hello.txt"` create a temporary alias of a command
    
    To make this permanent, write this in `.zprofile` present in root
    
-   `whoami` print the username
    
-   `cd`
    
    -   `cd` navigate to home directory
    -   `cd ..` move one directory up
-   `ls` list directories
    
    -   `ls` list items in the current directory
        
    -   `ls folder_path` list items inside a directory at a path
        
    -   `ls -a` list all the files including hidden files (starts with a dot)
        
    -   `ll` or `ls -l` long list items in the current directory
