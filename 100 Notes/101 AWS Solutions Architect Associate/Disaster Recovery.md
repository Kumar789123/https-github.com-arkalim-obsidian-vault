# Disaster Recovery
-   Any event that has a negative impact on a companyâ€™s business continuity or finances is a disaster
-   **Recovery Point Objective (RPO)**: how often you backup your data (determines how much data are you willing to lose in case of a disaster)
-   **Recovery Time Objective (RTO)**: how long it takes to recover from the disaster (down time)

## Strategies

#### Backup & Restore
- Backup every day or week => High RPO
- Need to spin up instances and restore volumes from snapshots in case of disaster => High RTO
- Cheapest & easiest to manage

#### Pilot Light
- **Critical parts of the app are always running** in the cloud (eg. continuous replication of data to another region) => Low RPO
- Critical systems are already up => Low RTO
- DB is critical so it is replicated continuously but EC2 instance is spin up only when a disaster strikes

#### Warm Standby
- A complete backup system is up and running at the minimum capacity. This system is quickly scaled to production capacity in case of a disaster.
- Very low RPO & RTO
- Expensive

#### Multi-Site or Hot Site Approach
- A backup system is running at full production capacity and the request can be routed to either the main or the backup system.
- Multi-data center approach
- Lowest RPO & RTO (minutes or seconds)
- Very Expensive
