# Route 53
- Global Service
- AWS managed **Authoritative DNS** (customer can update the DNS records and have full control over the [[Concepts#DNS|DNS]]) 
- Also a Domain Registrar (for registering domain names)
- Only AWS service which provides 100% availability SLA
- Affected by client's DNS caching (not suitable for [[Blue-Green Deployment]] if the client caches DNS queries)

## Hosted Zone
- A container for DNS records that define how to route traffic to a domain and its subdomains. 
- Hosted zone is queried to get the IP address from the hostname
- Two types:
	- **Public Hosted Zone**
		- resolves public domain names
		- can be queried by anyone on the internet
	- **Private Hosted Zone**
		- resolves private domain names
		- can only be queried from within the VPC

## Record Types
-   **A** - maps a hostname to IPv4
-   **AAAA** - maps a hostname to IPv6
-   **CNAME** - maps a hostname to another hostname
    -   The target is a domain name which must have an A or AAAA record
    -   **Cannot point to root domains (Zone Apex)**
      Ex: you can’t create a CNAME record for `example.com`, but you can create for `something.example.com`
-   **NS** (Name Servers) - controls how traffic is routed for a domain
- **Alias** - maps a hostname to an AWS resource
	- **AWS proprietary**
	- Can point to root and non-root domains
	- **Alias Record is of type A or AAAA** (IPv4 / IPv6)
	- Targets can be
		- Elastic Load Balancers
		- CloudFront Distributions
		- API Gateway
		- Elastic Beanstalk environments
		- S3 Websites
		- VPC Interface Endpoints
		- Global Accelerator accelerator
		- Route 53 record in the same hosted zone
	- **Target cannot be EC2**

## Routing Policies
#### Simple
- Route to one or more resources 
- If multiple values are returned, client chooses one at random (client-side load balancing)
- No health check (if returning multiple resources, some of them might be unhealthy)
- Image

#### Weighted
- Route a fraction of request to multiple resources
- Health checks
- Use case: testing a new application version by sending a small amount of traffic
- Can be used for **Active-Active failover** strategy
#### Latency-based
- Redirect to the resource that has the lowest latency
- Health checks
- Can be used for **Active-Active failover** strategy
#### Failover
- Primary & Secondary Records (if the primary application is down, route to secondary application)
- Health check must be associated with the primary record
- Used for **Active-Passive failover** strategy
#### Geolocation
- Routing based on the client's location
- Should create a “Default” record (in case there’s no match on location)
- Use cases: restrict content distribution & language preference
#### Geoproximity
- Route traffic to your resources based on the proximity of clients to the resources
- Ability to shift more traffic to resources based on the defined bias.
	-   To expand (bias: 1 to 99) → more traffic to the resource
	-   To shrink (bias: -1 to-99) → less traffic to the resource
-   Resources can be:
	-   AWS resources (specify AWS region)
	-   Non-AWS resources (specify Latitude and Longitude)
- Uses **Route 53 Traffic Flow**
#### Multi-value
- Route traffic to multiple resources (max 8)
- Health Checks (only healthy resources will be returned)

## Health Checks
- HTTP Health Checks are only for public resources
- Allows for Automated DNS Failover
- Three types:
	- Monitor an endpoint (application or other AWS resource)
		- Multiple global health checkers check the endpoint health
		- Must configure the application firewall to allow incoming requests from the IPs of Route 53 Health Checkers
		- Supported protocols: HTTP, HTTPS and TCP
	- Monitor other health checks (**Calculated Health Checks**)
		- Combine the results of multiple Health Checks into one (AND, OR, NOT)
		-   Specify how many of the health checks need to pass to make the parent pass
		-   Usage: perform maintenance to your website without causing all health checks to fail
	- Monitor CloudWatch Alarms (to perform health check on private resources)
		- Route 53 health checkers are outside the VPC. They can’t access private endpoints (private VPC or on-premises resources). 
		- Create a CloudWatch Metric and associate a CloudWatch Alarm to it, then create a Health Check that checks the CW alarm.

## GoDaddy with Route 53
- Use GoDaddy as registrar and Route 53 as DNS
	- Once we register a hostname at GoDaddy, we need to update the name servers (NS) of GoDaddy to match the name servers of a public hosted zone created in Route 53. This way, GoDaddy will use Route 53’s DNS.
