# Elastic Container Registry (ECR)
- AWS managed private Docker repository
- **Pay for the storage you use** to store docker images (no provisioning)
- Integrated with ECS & **IAM for security**
- Storage backed by [[Simple Storage Service (S3)|S3]]
- Can upload Docker images on ECR manually or we can use a CICD service like **CodeBuild**
