# Transit Gateway
- **Transitive peering** between thousands of VPCs and on-premise data centers using **hub-and-spoke (star) topology**
- Works with **Direct Connect Gateway**, **VPN Connection** and **VPC**
- Bound to a region 
- Transitive peering between VPCs in **different regions** but **same account**
- **Route Tables** to control communication within the transitive network
- Supports **IP Multicast** (not supported by any other AWS service)

## Increasing BW of Site-to-Site VPN connection
-   **ECMP** (Equal-cost multi-path routing) is a routing strategy to allow to forward a packet over multiple best path
-   To increase the bandwidth of the connection between Transit Gateway and corporate data center, create multiple site-to-site VPN connections, each with 2 tunnels (2 x 1.25 = 2.5 Gbps per VPN connection).

- Only one VPN connection to a VPC having 2 tunnels out of which only 1 is used (1.25 Gbps)

## Share DX between multiple Accounts
Share Transit Gateway across accounts using [[Resource Access Manager (RAM)|Resource Access Manager]] to share [[Direct Connect (DX)|Direct Connect]] connection between VPCs in **different regions & accounts**
