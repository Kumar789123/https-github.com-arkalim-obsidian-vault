# Resource Access Manager (RAM)
- Share AWS resources with **other AWS accounts** to avoid resource duplication
- Each participating account manage their own resources
- Participating accounts canâ€™t view, modify, delete resources that belong to other participants or the owner

## Sharing VPC Subnets
-   Allows to have all the resources launched in the same subnet
-   Can only share within the organization
-   Cannot share security groups and default VPC
-   Network is shared
    -   every resource deployed in the subnet can talk to each other using private IP
    -   security groups from other accounts can be referenced
