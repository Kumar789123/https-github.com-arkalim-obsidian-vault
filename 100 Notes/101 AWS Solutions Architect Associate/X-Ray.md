# X-Ray
- Provides an **end-to-end view of requests as they travel through your application**, and shows a map of your applicationâ€™s underlying components.
- AWS X-Ray helps developers analyze and debug production, distributed applications, such as those built using a **micro-services architecture**. 
- Helps understand how your application and its underlying services are performing to identify and troubleshoot the root cause of performance issues and errors. 
- Can collect data across AWS Accounts. The **X-Ray agent** can **assume a role** to publish data into an account different from the one in which it is running. This enables you to publish data from various components of your application into a **central account**.
